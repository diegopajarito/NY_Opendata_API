# NY Opendata API
This is a project to share my scripts for accessing and analysing the NY Open Data Portal and API.

* First Script [Traffic](traffic.py) aimed to test the API and get some traffic data and mapped into a GIS tool. 

* Second Script [Intersection](area_intersection.py) aimed to calculate the intersection areas between two layers in QGIS. 

* All files created are available inside the [Output](output) folder.
